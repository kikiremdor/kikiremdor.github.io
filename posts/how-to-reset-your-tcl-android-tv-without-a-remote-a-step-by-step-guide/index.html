Finally, you can now remove the USB stick and enjoy your TV experience again!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhwhFFUW1j4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the first step to resetting a TCL Android TV without a remote?
