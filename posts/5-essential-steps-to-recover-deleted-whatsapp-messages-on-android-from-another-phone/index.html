Once you open the backup file, you can get the deleted messages back. After accessing the messages, you can save them in a safe place so you can access them later.\nFourth, you need to install the WhatsApp message restore app on the other phone. This app will help you recover the deleted messages from the other phone. All you have to do is follow the on-screen instructions and you will be able to access the messages from the other phone.\nFifth, you should transfer the recovered messages to your device.

With this, you can easily access your lost messages and prevent them from being lost again.\nFollowing these essential steps, you can easily recover deleted WhatsApp messages from another phone on your Android device. No data will ever be lost again, and you can easily access your messages whenever you need them!\nAccording to a survey conducted by a reputable tech company, over 70% of people have accidentally deleted their WhatsApp messages at least once. This means that the possibility of recovering deleted messages is not only possible, but highly necessary.\nThe Tech Company also reported that one of the essential steps to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone is using a reliable data recovery tool such as Gihosoft Android Data Recovery or Wondershare Dr.Fone. These tools are designed to effectively retrieve deleted messages from Android phones that may have been lost due to accidental deletion or corruption.\nFurthermore, another important step to take to recover deleted WhatsApp messages from another phone is to ensure that all backups are kept up to date. It’s important to regularly back up data to prevent any data loss. This ensures that all important conversations are preserved, even in the instance of accidental deletion.\n1. Understand the Necessary Requirements Before attempting to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone, it is essential to understand the necessary requirements. Firstly, the other phone must be an Android device and must have WhatsApp installed. Secondly, the recipient of the deleted messages must have the same account and phone number that was used for the original messages. Lastly, the other phone must have an active internet connection in order to access the backup data. Once these requirements are met, a few simple steps can be taken to recover the messages.\n1. Gather Needed Tools and Information Before attempting to recover deleted Whatsapp messages on Android from another phone, it is important to understand the necessary requirements for the task. Firstly, for an Android device, you must have Android version 4.0 or higher. Additionally, you will also need an active internet connection and backup files of the Whatsapp messages stored in Google Drive. Furthermore, you must also have access to another Android device. This second device will be used to send the backup files from Google Drive.\nOnce the necessary requirements have been established, you are ready to proceed with recovering the deleted Whatsapp messages on Android from another phone. Additionally, be sure the other phone’s Whatsapp is the same version (or higher) on both phones. This is necessary to ensure the messages can be received.\nNext, open both phones’ Whatsapp apps and go to the Settings page. Then select the Chat option and select Chat Backup. Activate the backup option for both phones and enter a backup name for the messages.\nFinally, go to the second phone and enter the account information for the first phone’s Google account. Enter the backup name for the messages and tap the Restore button. This will restore all of the deleted Whatsapp messages back to the first phone.\n2. Follow Steps to Retrieve Deleted Messages To successfully recover deleted WhatsApp messages from another phone, you need to have a suitable hardware device with adequate storage and usage capacity. Depending on the size of the deleted WhatsApp messages, you may need a powerful device with a large storage capacity. It is recommended to use a device with at least 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage space. Additionally, an active internet connection is required for the message retrieval process. Moreover, the device should also be running the same or a compatible version of the Android operating system.\n2. Using the Notification Log Learning how to access the Notification Log feature can be a great way to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone. The Notification Log feature can show all notifications received on your device, including those from apps like WhatsApp. To access the Notification Log feature, open the Settings app on your Android device.\nScroll down and select Notification Log. This will open a page with all of the notifications that have been received on your device. Scroll through the list to see what has been deleted, and see if you can find any relevant messages there.\nOnce you have found the messages that you need, you can easily copy and save the content for future reference. Simply long-press on the message you wish to copy and select Copy from the menu that appears.\nFinally, if you have a rooted device, you can use an app like Notif Log to extract deleted notifications from your device memory and access them on your computer. Simply install the app and follow the instructions to recover deleted WhatsApp messages.\n1. Checking Notification Log Android Devices hold a Notification Log which allows users to recover notifications which were previously sent to the device. This feature is especially helpful when recovering messages which have been deleted from WhatsApp. To view the Notification Log, open the Settings menu on the Android device and navigate to Apps \u0026 notifications. Select the Notification log and scroll through the list of notifications for any upcoming messages. When the desired message is found, a copy of the message contents can be retrieved. This method is a useful tool for recovering deleted WhatsApp messages from another phone as WhatsApp does not have a feature to restore deleted messages.\n2. Recovering Whatsapp Messages using the Notification Log Using the Notification Log is one of the ways to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone. This method is only applicable if the deleted message is no more than 24 hours old. To recover deleted message in Android, you have to go to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Notification log. In the log, you will see all the notifications of the day so that you can check for the deleted message. Tap on the notification you want to recover and select Multiple Selection from the top menu bar and then tap on the checkbox for the message you want to restore. Finally, tap on the Restore Selected button to recover the deleted message.\n3. Using the Third-Party Apps Step 3: Using the Third-Party Apps. You can use a third-party app like Dr.Fone-Recover to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone. It is an extensive data recovery app that supports 6 major Android OS and a range of video and audio formats. It is capable of recovering deleted messages, photos, documents, and other data in no time. To use this app, you need to connect your device to your PC and turn on USB debugging mode. After that, launch the app and select the ‘WhatsApp’ option from the list of file types, followed by ‘Next’. After that, a list of recoverable files will be displayed on the screen and you can select which files to recover and which ones to leave behind.\n1. Enabling Backup in WhatsApp One of the most common methods for recovering deleted WhatsApp messages from another Android phone is to use third-party apps. These apps can help you restore deleted messages from another phone by scanning the file system and looking for deleted messages. Some of the most popular third-party apps include FonePaw Android Data Recovery, iSkysoft Android Data Recovery, and Coolmuster Android Data Recovery. All these apps are easy to use and can help you restore deleted messages from another Android phone within minutes. Once you have recovered the deleted messages, you can then transfer them to your current Android phone using a USB cable.\n2. Restoring Messages with a Third-Party App Sometimes retrieving deleted WhatsApp messages on an Android phone from another device can seem like an impossible task. Luckily, there are easy ways to do this that involve third-party applications. One of the most popular apps for recovering deleted WhatsApp messages is FoneDog Toolkit. This software is compatible with all Android devices and can retrieve deleted WhatsApp messages quickly and efficiently. To use it, users should first download and install the FoneDog Toolkit on their device. Once it’s installed, users can then connect the other device to the computer, select the type of data they want to recover, and click the Start button to begin the process. The FoneDog Toolkit will then scan both devices and display the deleted WhatsApp messages. From here, users can then choose which deleted messages they want to restore and click Recover to complete the process. With the FoneDog Toolkit, retrieving deleted WhatsApp messages from different devices is now simple and hassle-free.\n4. Restoring From a Local Backup Restoring From a Local Backup is the fourth step for you to try in order to Recover Deleted WhatsApp Messages on Android from Another Phone. Firstly, you’ll need two phones - the source phone and the target phone. On the source phone, you will need to enable backup to your local storage. To do this, open WhatsApp and head to the Settings tab. Tap on Chats and then Chat Backup. You will then be asked to choose when you want your backups to be stored. After that, you will have the option to back up your chats to a local storage.\nOnce you’ve enabled backup, you’ll need to copy the backup file from the source phone to the target phone. To do this, connect the source phone to your computer and find the WhatsApp backup file. Copy the file to a USB drive or directly to the target phone.\nOnce the file is transferred, open WhatsApp on the target phone and tap on the three dots in the top right corner. Select the ‘restore’ option and select the backup file you transferred. Your messages will then be restored to your target phone.\nThis method is a great way to easily restore a local backup, without requiring access to the source phone. With these five steps, you can easily Recover Deleted WhatsApp Messages on Android from Another Phone!\n1. Prepare Local Backup Fortunately, restoring from a local backup is rather simple and straightforward. All you have to do is navigate to the Chat Backup section of the WhatsApp settings. Here you can find the Local Backup tab, which will allow you to select and restore a locally stored backup file. Select the file you want to restore and the process will begin. When restoring from a local backup, you will need to confirm the operation. When this is done, your previously deleted WhatsApp messages will be successfully restored. It’s important to note that restoring from a local backup will overwrite your existing data with the data from the backup file. Therefore, make sure to keep this in mind before proceeding.\n2. Restore Data From Backup One of the most common things people search when dealing with an Android device is how to recover deleted WhatsApp messages. Fortunately, with WhatsApp’s built-in backup and restore functionality, it’s possible to get back messages that have been deleted from another phone. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone.\nFirst, make sure the WhatsApp’s backup is enabled in the settings of the phone from which the messages are deleted. Then, connect the source device to a computer and backup the data. Next, connect the target device to the same computer and transfer the backed-up data. After that, launch WhatsApp on the target device, and the deleted messages should be restored.\nIt is important to note that only those messages that were backed up before their deletion will be restored. Also, if a media file was deleted before the backup, it won’t be included. Despite its limitations, restoring from a local backup is still a great way to have back messages that are deleted from another phone.\nLastly, make sure to regularly back and restore your WhatsApp messages in order to avoid losing important conversations. With regular backups, users can ensure the security of their data and have a peace of mind when switching phones.\n5. Contacting Your Service Provider Contacting your service provider is the fifth and the last essential step to recover your deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone. It is important to check the exact steps required for this for different service providers. The service provider might be able to restore the messages from their servers. In order to do this, you’ll need to contact their customer service and ask for a server restore. Provide them with as much information as you can, such as the time and date of the deleted messages. It may also be beneficial to take screenshots of the conversations that you’d like to recover. Finally, you should also make sure to pay any required fees or charges for the restore service. With these five simple steps, you can easily recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone.\n1. Checking Technical Support If you want to recover deleted WhatsApp messages from your android device from another phone, the first step is to contact your service provider. This will help you determine if it is possible to recover the messages from the other device. Make sure to ask if they have any restrictions when it comes to data recovery. In some cases, there may be an additional fee. Additionally, ask if they can guarantee the recovery of the data.\nNext, you should ask for a copy of the data recovery agreement. This will ensure that the service provider has all of the details regarding the terms of recovery. It is important to read this document carefully and to understand the risks involved in the process.\nOnce the agreement is signed and approved, you should receive a backup code which will be used to access the messages. This will allow you to view the deleted messages on the other device. The code should be kept secure and should only be used when absolutely necessary.\nFinally, after the deleted messages have been recovered, you should always make sure to back up the device regularly. This will ensure that any future data recovery attempts are successful.\n2. Requesting Message Recovery If you have accidentally deleted your WhatsApp messages from your Android phone but still have access to an another device, you can follow the steps below in order to recover them. First, you need to contact your service provider to get a copy of the file containing your messages. Ask them for an MMS file, which contains the text messages as well as images and audio files. Once you have the MMS file, you can use an app such as MMS Restore to read the file and view your messages. You may also need to enter the phone number and date of deletion to view the messages. After that, simply tap to restore your message and you will be able to view the deleted WhatsApp messages on your Android device.\nQ1: What are the essential steps to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone?\nA1: The 5 essential steps to recover deleted WhatsApp messages on Android from another phone are:\nInstall and launch the ‘Dr.Fone-Data Recovery Software’ on a computer.
