The website also suggests using apps such as Send Anywhere or Share Files Quickly as an alternative, if Bluetooth is not available.\nStatistics from Apple reveal that in 2019, the number of iPhone users worldwide exceeded 900 million. With the vast majority of these users already owning an Android device, this makes the Bluetooth transfer of photos between the two devices even more essential.\n1. Check Bluetooth Compatibility Transferring photos between devices can be both tedious and time-consuming. It doesn’t have to be though, as there are many ways to quickly and easily transfer photos from an iPhone to an Android device. One of the most convenient methods is to do so via Bluetooth. However, before setting up the transfer, one must first check if the two devices are compatible.\nTo check Bluetooth compatibility, the first step is to ensure that both devices have Bluetooth enabled. On an iPhone, toggle on Bluetooth by going to the Control Center. On Android, it can be turned on from the Settings menu. Both devices should then appear in each other’s Bluetooth devices list. If either one is not present, then the devices are incompatible.\nIf the two devices can see each other, then they are compatible. The next step is to pair the devices. On an iPhone, select the Android device from the list. On Android, enter the pairing code that is displayed on the iPhone. Once both devices confirm the pairing, they will be connected.\nThe last step is to transfer the photos. On the iPhone, select the photos to be transferred and choose the Android device as the destination. On Android, accept the photos and confirm the transfer. After a few moments, the operation should be completed and the photos will now be on the Android device.\n2. Prepare for Bluetooth Transfer Before sending photos from an iPhone to an Android device using Bluetooth, it is important to check that both devices are compatible with each other. Generally, most modern Bluetooth-enabled devices will be compatible, but it is always a good idea to check the specifications of the device before proceeding. Additionally, it is also important that both devices are running the exact same version of Bluetooth.\nOnce users have confirmed that both devices are Bluetooth compatible, they should make both of them visible to the other device. For Android devices, this can usually be done through the device’s Settings \u003e Network \u0026 Internet \u003e Bluetooth settings, while for iPhones, this can be done by opening the Control Center and tapping the Bluetooth icon.\nAfter both devices have become visible, users can tap on the other device to initiate the pairing process. If a PIN or password is requested, simply enter it to confirm the connection and establish a secure connection between the two devices.\nOnce the connection is established, users can select the photos they would like to send from their iPhone and simply press the “Send” button. They will then be able to view the photo on the other device.\n3.
