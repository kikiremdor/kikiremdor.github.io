Oleh karena itu, aplikasi pihak ketiga, seperti Power Off FREE yang disebutkan oleh pakar teknologi, dapat menjadi cara yang lebih aman untuk mematikan perangkat Anda tanpa harus menyentuh layar.\nSelama proses power-off, ada juga beberapa kemungkinan yang harus dipertimbangkan, yaitu: pastikan untuk menyimpan semua data Anda, keluar dari aplikasi yang aktif, dan biarkan layar menyala selama proses power off - dengan begitu, Anda tidak perlu khawatir akan membuat kerusakan pada smartphone Anda.\n1. Install a Power Off App Powering off your Android phone without touching the screen may sound difficult but it actually quite simple. All you need is an app called Power Off that you can download directly from the Play Store. This app will allow you to power off your Android phone quickly without having to risk the possibility of the screen being damaged.\nOnce you download and install the Power Off app, you’ll have to give the app permission to access device administrator settings. After that, you can pick a safe time to power off your device.

This also gives you the convenience of not having to press the power button every time you want to turn it on.\nFinally, the Power Off app also includes a widget which can power off your device without having to manually open the app. This makes powering off your Android phone incredibly fast and convenient. With this app, you can rest assured that your phone will be safely powered off without damaging the screen.\nI. Steps to Install a Power Off App Android smartphones are an invaluable resource in our lives.
