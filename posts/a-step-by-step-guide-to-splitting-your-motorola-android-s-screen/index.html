This is usually a square button with two arrows on it or an icon with four boxes beside it. Tap it to bring up the window switcher.\nOnce you have the window switcher open, you’ll be able to choose two different apps to split-screen.

You can switch between the two apps by tapping the app switcher button again, or by simply swiping on the display itself.\nSplitting your screen can be a great way to multitask and get more done quickly. Whether you’re browsing the web, checking your emails, or watching a movie, you can now do it all at the same time with your Motorola Android device. So, what are you waiting for?
