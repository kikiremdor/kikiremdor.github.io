On the sender&rsquo;s device, navigate to the file you wish to send, and then tap the “Share” or “Send” button. The “Share/Send” button will bring up a list of sharing options, including Bluetooth. Select Bluetooth to begin the transfer.</p><p>On the receiving device, select the “Accept” or “Receive” button. The sender device should then show a prompt asking for permission to send the data. Tap the “Allow” button to begin the data transfer.</p><p>Once the data transfer is complete, a notification will appear on both sender and receiver devices. The transferred file can now be found on the receiver device in the designated folder. By following these steps, users can easily transfer application data from one Android device to another via Bluetooth.</p><h2 id=3-receiving-app-data-on-the-other-device>3. Receiving app data on the other device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-receiving-app-data-on-the-other-device>#</a></h2><p>Transferring app data from one Android device to another is an easy process. All you need is a computer or a laptop with a Bluetooth connection. To begin, you need to pair both Android devices via the Bluetooth settings. Both devices should be visible in the Bluetooth menu. On the receiving device, you need to turn on Bluetooth visibility. Once both devices are successfully paired, you can start the data transfer.</p><p>Go to the app you want to transfer on the sending device and select the “Share” option. Select “Bluetooth” as your sharing option and choose the receiving device. The app will then ask you to confirm the data transfer. After confirmation, the files from the sending device will be transferred to the receiving device. The data will be stored in the same app folder on the receiving device.</p><p>The transfer process is fairly simple but you should note that both devices need to have the same app installed. The transfer will not work if the receiving device does not have the app installed. Also, there might be inconsistencies between versions on both devices. To ensure smooth data transfer, it is recommended to check if both devices have the same version of the app installed.</p><p>In conclusion, transferring app data from one Android device to another is a simple process.
